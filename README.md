## Features
* Data is stored in a local database - no need to make an account or rely on the uptime of some server
* Cuts down on displayed information to provide a cleaner user interface
* Choose between using the original or translated title for Japanese media
* A simplified favourite / like / dislike rating system because score-based rating is a waste of time


## Running
Download the correct version depending on your operating system and extract it. Then,
* Windows: Run `tsundoku.exe`.
* Linux: Execute `tsundoku` from Terminal.

## Uninstalling
Delete the folder you downloaded. To remove your config file and local database generated by tsundoku,
* Windows: Delete `<User>\AppData\Local\tsundoku`.
* Linux: Delete `~/.local/share/tsundoku`.

## Building
**tsundoku** uses a default Java 21.0.4 JDK and is built with [JavaPackager](https://github.com/fvarrui/JavaPackager) and Maven. Note that tsundoku is packaged with Java and all dependencies included, and you will have to provide the proper JDKs to build it. In `pom.xml` in the project's root folder, you may adjust the JavaPackager configuration to adjust the JDK locations used.

Download the source code, extract it, and navigate to the project's root folder. Then,
* Windows: From cmd, run `mvn package -Djavafx.platform=win`.
* Linux: From Terminal, run `mvn package`.

The tsundoku-\<version\>-\<operating system\> archives are the ones provided in the `releases` section of this repository.

## Acknowledgements
**tsundoku** serves as a combined front end for different APIs and data sources and could not work without them.
* Anime: [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/), which gets the original data from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
