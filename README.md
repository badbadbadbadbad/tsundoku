## Features
* Data is stored in a local database - no need to make an account or rely on the uptime of some server
* Cuts down on displayed information to provide a cleaner user interface
* Choose between using the original or translated title for Japanese media
* A simplified favourite / like / dislike rating system because score-based rating is a waste of time


## Running
Download the correct version depending on your operating system and extract it. Then,
* Windows: Run `tsundoku.exe`.
* Linux: Execute `tsundoku` from Terminal.

## Uninstalling
Delete the folder you downloaded. To remove your config file and local database generated by tsundoku,
* Windows: Delete `<User>\AppData\Local\tsundoku`.
* Linux: Delete `~/.local/share/tsundoku`.

## Building
**tsundoku** is built using Maven and JavaPackager. To lessen the annoyance of tinkering with JavaPackager, 
automatic build scripts for both Windows and Linux are provided.
These scripts automatically download the required JDK and Maven versions, 
builds the platform-specific version into the project root, 
then removes the temporary files used for the build process.
* Windows: In the project root, run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build-windows.ps1`.
* Linux: In the project root, run `chmod +x build-linux.sh` to make the script executable, then run `./build-linux.sh`.


The tsundoku-\<version\>-\<operating system\> archives in the `releases` section of this repository are built the same way.

## Acknowledgements
**tsundoku** serves as a combined front end for different APIs and data sources and could not work without them.
* Anime: [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/), which gets the original data from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
