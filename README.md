## Features
* No forums or similar social features to clutter up pages
* All data in your backlog is stored in a local database, hence always available
* Choose between using the original or translated title for Japanese media
* Rate media as **heart**, **liked**, or **disliked** as score-based rating is a waste of time


## Running
Download the latest (or otherwise desired) version from the [Releases](https://github.com/badbadbadbadbad/tsundoku/releases) section and extract it, then:
* Windows: Run `tsundoku.exe`
* Linux: Execute `tsundoku` from Terminal


## Using
The **Browse** views represent your interaction point with the original data sources, split by media type, letting you check out popular or recent releases as well as search for specific media. Anything you can find here, you may add to your personal log - simply click on the item of your choice, change the personal status dropdown to your desired value, and save the changes.<br>

Each media type uses a different API to acquire the data, with all of them (besides anime) requiring API credentials to access. In order to use a service, you will have to generate your own (free) API credentials for it, then enter that data in the Settings menu. Be aware that any credentials you enter will be saved in a configuration file on your device, specifically so you are not bound by the uptime of some authentification service.

The **Log** views represent all the media you've consumed or have in your backlog, split by media type, letting you track your progress and manage your personal library. Any item that is in your personal log is permanently saved in your local database (unless removed later), meaning that you may interact with your backlog, even if the corresponding media type API or your own internet connection are unavailable. Items are first sorted by personal status, then by personal rating, then alphanumerically.<br>

Upcoming media may have some of their data fields (e.g. release date) unprovided, yet be available to add to your log, which causes incomplete data in your personal database. To remedy this issue, tsundoku will periodically poll the original data sources for updates on any media in your backlog. Hence, it is recommended to leave tsundoku open in the background every so often, giving the program a chance to keep all of your data upd to date.

All items in the Browse and Log views change their border colour based on the following colour key:
| Colour | Meaning |
|:------:|---------|
| Gold | Heart rating |
| Green | Liked rating |
| Red | Disliked rating |
| Cyan | Unrated (Browse views) |
| Grey | Unrated (Log views)<br>Not in backlog (Browse views) |


## Uninstalling
Simply delete the folder you downloaded. To remove your configuration file and local database generated by tsundoku:
* Windows: Delete `<User>\AppData\Local\tsundoku`
* Linux: Delete `~/.local/share/tsundoku`

## Building
tsundoku is built using Maven and JavaPackager. Build scripts for both Windows and Linux are provided to remove the hassle of configuring JavaPackager for your environment.
* Windows: In the project root, run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build-windows.ps1`
* Linux: In the project root, run `chmod +x build-linux.sh` to make the script executable, then execute `./build-linux.sh`

The tsundoku-\<version\>-\<operating system\> archives in the `releases` section of this repository are built the same way.

## Credits
tsundoku serves as a combined front end for different APIs and data sources and could not work without them.
* Anime: [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/), which gets the original data from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
